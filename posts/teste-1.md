CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used for web development to define the layout, appearance, and design of web pages. It works in conjunction with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

## Benefits of CSS

- Separation of Concerns: CSS allows developers to separate the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS) and behavior (JavaScript), making it easier to manage and maintain web pages.

- Consistent Styling: CSS enables consistent styling across multiple web pages, making it easy to apply changes to the design and layout of an entire website.

- Flexibility: CSS provides developers with a wide range of styling options, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, allowing for creative and unique web designs.

## Basic CSS Syntax

CSS rules consist of a selector, followed by a declaration block. The selector specifies which HTML elements to style, and the declaration block contains one or more property-value pairs that define the appearance of the selected elements. For example:

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```
