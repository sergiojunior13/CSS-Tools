## Introduction

The CSS `box-shadow` property is used to apply shadows to HTML elements. These shadows can be both horizontal and vertical. Here's a simple example of the syntax:

```css
/* offsetX | offsetY | blur | spread | color */
box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px 5px #000000;
```

Each value of `box-shadow` represents a different aspect of the shadow effect. Let's break down these values:

`offsetX`: Specifies the horizontal distance of the shadow from the element. A positive value moves the shadow to the right, while a negative value moves it to the left.

`offsetY`: Specifies the vertical distance of the shadow from the element. A positive value moves the shadow downward, while a negative value moves it upward.

`blur`: Defines the blurriness of the shadow.

`spread`: Indicates the size of the shadow.

`color`: Sets the color of the shadow. It can be specified using a color name, hexadecimal, RGB, or any other valid CSS color format.

## Inner Shadow

If you want to create an inner shadow effect, you can use the `inset` keyword before the values. If it is not specified (default), the shadow will appear as a drop shadow, thereby creating the illusion that the element is above the content. But if you use it, the shadow will be assumed to be as if the content were debossed inside the box. Let's see an example:

```css
box-shadow: inset 5px 5px 10px 8px #fff;
```

## Adding Multiples Shadows

The `box-shadow` property also supports adding multiple shadows. To add a new shadow, just separate the shadow code by a comma. There's no limit to how many shadows you can put on. See the example below:

```css
box-shadow: 12px -12px 20px 0 #ff0000, -12px 12px 20px 0 #00c8ff;
```

With multiple shadows, you can create a variety of types of shadows, like rainbow shadows, gradient shadows, and many others.

## Generating a Box Shadow

To simplify the process of generating box-shadow code, there are several online tools available. Our website also provides a box shadow generator that you can use. Simply visit our [box shadow generator](/box-shadow-generator/) to access it.

With the generator, you can interactively adjust the values and see the resulting box shadow in real-time. It also supports adding multiple shadows. It allows you to experiment with different shadow effects and quickly generate the corresponding CSS code.
